# Automotive-Application-Using-CAN-MATLAB

## Objectives
To implement a distributed Electronic Control Unit (ECU) network on CAN for an automobile 
using MATLAB simulation. The simulation uses the CAN Configuration, CAN Pack, CAN 
Transmit, CAN Receive and CAN Unpack blocks to perform data transfer over a CAN bus.
## Abstract 
In-vehicle networks are the backbone of the electronic operations of a car. A vehicle is essentially 
a distributed embedded system. The CAN is the most common protocol within this system. 
Vehicle Network Toolbox provides a direct connection from the CAN networks to MATLAB and 
Simulink, enabling you to inspect, test, and validate the operation of a vehicle before an actual 
dynamic event.
The model consists of the following subsystems: Vehicle dynamics model, Sensors and actuators, 
Turn signal, Dashboard, brake light and Speed controller. The Vehicle dynamics model represents 
the automobile (the environment), and the other subsystems represent the various nodes on the 
CAN bus.
## Hardware/Software Requirements:
1. MATLAB
2. Simulink
3. Vehicle Network Toolbox
